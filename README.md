## Self-Introduction: Juan Sanchez
Hi All! My name is Juan Sanchez, and I am from Denver, CO. I was born and raised in Colorado, but my family is originally from Guanajuato, Mexico. I am a first year in
the DSI masters program. I am relatively new to data science. I completed a BSBA in Marketing and Finance, as well as a BS in Accounting at the University of Denver 
this Summer! My favorite type of food is Mexican, of course, and in my free time I enjoy catching up with friends and family.
